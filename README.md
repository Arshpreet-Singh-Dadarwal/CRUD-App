# 🗂️ CRUD Application (Node.js + EJS)

This is a simple **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application** built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **EJS**.  
I created this project to practice backend development and understand how server-side rendering works with EJS. The app also supports **image upload**, making it more practical and real-world oriented.
